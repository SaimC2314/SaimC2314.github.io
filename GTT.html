    <p>Japanese cult RB26DETT engine was first represented in 1989, and it was meant specially for the legendary car Nissan Skyline GT-R R32. However, it did not       prevent the owners of Nissan 300ZX, Nissan 350Z, Ford Mustang, Infiniti G35, etc., to use the engine for their autos as well. 
        In contrast to RB25DET, RB26DETT uses cylinder block without oil port, also it has crankshaft with 73.7 mm piston stroke, connecting rods are installed (as on RB25DET NEO), new pistons (they are 1mm lower), and compression ratio is 8.5. Cylinder block is covered with aluminium head with 24 valves and no variable valve timing system. RB26DETT camshafts: duration 240/236 deg, lift 8.58/8.28 mm. Also instead of hydraulic lifters, the engine has solid lifters. 
        Inlet valves are 34.5 mm in diameter, while diameter of exhaust valves is 30 mm. The intake system uses individual throttle bodies. Each of 6 throttle bodies is 45 mm in diameter. RB26DETT firing order is 1-5-3-6-2-4.
        Air gets into intake manifold with help of two Garrett M24 turbochargers with ceramic impeller. Maximal boost pressure is 10 psi (0.7 bar). Fuel injectors are 444 cc/min.
        Thanks to all these mods 280 HP at 6,800 RPM is gained, and torque 353 NM at 4,400 RPM. 
        Such engines are installed on Skyline GTR R32 and Skyline GTR R33, usually they are called RB26DETT Black top.
        Nissan Skyline GT-R R34 uses ball bearing Garrett M24 turbochargers. These are RB26DETT Red top engines.
        RB26DETT has timing belt, which should be changed every 60,000 miles of mileage (90,000 km). RB26DETT was discontinued in 2002, and its successor appeared in 2007. It was VR38DETT, used for Nissan GTR R35.
        Also sport version RB26DETT N1 was produced. Its main differences from RB26DETT are the following: improved cylinder block (cooling system was updated), marked as 24U, and also reinforced connecting rods, pistons, turbochargers Garrett M24 with steel impeller, upgraded turbo manifold. 
        On RB26DETT N1 the oil pump problem was solved and it was equipped with new water pump.
        This engine is called RB26DETT Gold top, and it was usually applied for Nissan Skyline GTR R34 Nur spec.
        In 2002 N1 was replaced with purely sporty engine VQ30DETT.
        Besides RB26DETT, RB series included such engines as RB24S, RB25DE/DET, RB20DET/RB20DE and RB30S/E/ET. - <a href="http://mywikimotors.com/rb25det/">Website Credit</a></p>
