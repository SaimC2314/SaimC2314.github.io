    <h1>Nissan Skyline GT (155 hp)</h1>

    <img src="GT_Sedan.jpg" alt="A Nissan Skyline R34 GT Sedan"></a>

    <p>In 1984 the legendary Nissan RB series appeared. <mark>RB20</mark> became its first representative. It is the smallest RB-engine, the substitution to old L20. There are several versions of this engine, which somewhat differ from one another.
        The first version <mark>RB20E</mark> was cast iron straight-6 engine with aluminium head. The head had the only one camshaft and 2 valves per cylinder. <mark>RB20E</mark> power is 115-130 HP, depending on generation. In general, this engine is not popular and there is nothing special about it.
        In 1985 <mark>RB20ET</mark> appeared, it was turbocharged <mark>RB20E</mark>. Its boost pressure was 7 psi (0.5 bar), the engine did not have any intercooler. <mark>RB20ET</mark> power reached 170 HP, though some versions were only 145 HP powerful.
        Also in 1985 the most popular <mark>RB20DE</mark> was produced. Its main difference from <mark>RB20E</mark> was new head with two camshafts and 4 valves per cylinder. Also <mark>RB20DE</mark> was equipped with individual ignition coils, new crankshaft, modified connecting rods, pistons and intake system, new ECU. <mark>RB20DE</mark> camshafts: duration 232/240 deg, lift 7.3/7.8 mm. The engines developed 150-165 HP, and they were installed on such Nissan models, as Skyline R31/R32, Cefiro A31, Laurel C33/C34.
        If your timing belt breaks, <mark>RB20DE</mark> will fold the valves.
        In 2000 <mark>RB20DE</mark> was upgraded with new crankshaft, improved intake system, modified head with no hydraulic lifters, another ECU. Such modified engines were called <mark>RB20DE NEO</mark>. They conformed to higher ecological standards. They were 155 HP powerful.
        You may see <mark>RB20DE NEO</mark> under the hood of Nissan Skyline R34, Stagea C34, Laurel C35.
        In 1985 turbocharged <mark>RB20DE</mark> was produced, that was <mark>RB20DET</mark>. The engines used 16V turbocharger, and their maximal boost pressure was 7 psi (0.5 bar). They were also equipped with new pistons, connecting rods, another camshaft, cylinder head gasket, ECU, and compression ratio was reduced to 8.5. <mark>RB20DET</mark> fuel injectors were 270 cc/min. The first models (<mark>RB20DET</mark> Red top for Skyline R31) used NICS intake system.
        RB20DET camshafts: duration 248/240 deg, lift 7.8/7.8 mm.
        All that let developing 180-190 HP, depending on a model.
        Later, since 1988, the engines got ECCS system and new camshafts. Such modified engine is usually called <mark>RB20DET</mark> Silver top. <mark>RB20DET</mark> Silver top camshafts have duration 240/240 deg, lift 7.8/7.8 mm. It increased the power to 215 HP at 6,400 RPM.
        <mark>RB20DET</mark> was discontinued in 1993, being substituted with naturally aspirated <mark>RB25DE</mark> with almost the same power.
        If you have <mark>RB20DE</mark> or <mark>RB20DET</mark> under the hood, there is no necessity to regulate the valves. But if your car is equipped with <mark>RB20DE NEO</mark> engine, then you should regulate them sometimes. All <mark>RB20</mark> versions have timing belt, which should be changed every 60,000 miles of mileage (90,000 km).
        Besides <mark>RB20</mark>, RB series included such engines as <mark>RB24S</mark>, <mark>RB25DE/DET</mark>, <mark>RB26DETT</mark> and <mark>RB30S/E/ET</mark>.
        When <mark>RB20DE/E</mark> was discontinued, it was replaced with <mark>VQ23DE</mark>. - <a href="http://mywikimotors.com/rb20det/">Website Credit</a></p>
