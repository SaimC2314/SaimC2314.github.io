    <p>In 1984 the legendary Nissan RB series appeared. RB20 became its first representative. It is the smallest RB-engine, the substitution to old L20. There are      several versions of this engine, which somewhat differ from one another.
        The first version RB20E was cast iron straight-6 engine with aluminium head. The head had the only one camshaft and 2 valves per cylinder. RB20E power is 115-130 HP, depending on generation. In general, this engine is not popular and there is nothing special about it.
        In 1985 RB20ET appeared, it was turbocharged RB20E. Its boost pressure was 7 psi (0.5 bar), the engine did not have any intercooler. RB20ET power reached 170 HP, though some versions were only 145 HP powerful.
        Also in 1985 the most popular RB20DE was produced. Its main difference from RB20E was new head with two camshafts and 4 valves per cylinder. Also RB20DE was equipped with individual ignition coils, new crankshaft, modified connecting rods, pistons and intake system, new ECU. RB20DE camshafts: duration 232/240 deg, lift 7.3/7.8 mm. The engines developed 150-165 HP, and they were installed on such Nissan models, as Skyline R31/R32, Cefiro A31, Laurel C33/C34.
        If your timing belt breaks, RB20DE will fold the valves.
        In 2000 RB20DE was upgraded with new crankshaft, improved intake system, modified head with no hydraulic lifters, another ECU. Such modified engines were called RB20DE NEO. They conformed to higher ecological standards. They were 155 HP powerful.
        You may see RB20DE NEO under the hood of Nissan Skyline R34, Stagea C34, Laurel C35.
        In 1985 turbocharged RB20DE was produced, that was RB20DET. The engines used 16V turbocharger, and their maximal boost pressure was 7 psi (0.5 bar). They were also equipped with new pistons, connecting rods, another camshaft, cylinder head gasket, ECU, and compression ratio was reduced to 8.5. RB20DET fuel injectors were 270 cc/min. The first models (RB20DET Red top for Skyline R31) used NICS intake system.
        RB20DET camshafts: duration 248/240 deg, lift 7.8/7.8 mm.
        All that let developing 180-190 HP, depending on a model.
        Later, since 1988, the engines got ECCS system and new camshafts. Such modified engine is usually called RB20DET Silver top. RB20DET Silver top camshafts have duration 240/240 deg, lift 7.8/7.8 mm. It increased the power to 215 HP at 6,400 RPM.
        RB20DET was discontinued in 1993, being substituted with naturally aspirated RB25DE with almost the same power.
        If you have RB20DE or RB20DET under the hood, there is no necessity to regulate the valves. But if your car is equipped with RB20DE NEO engine, then you should regulate them sometimes. All RB20 versions have timing belt, which should be changed every 60,000 miles of mileage (90,000 km).
        Besides RB20, RB series included such engines as RB24S, RB25DE/DET, RB26DETT and RB30S/E/ET.
        When RB20DE/E was discontinued, it was replaced with VQ23DE. - <a href="http://mywikimotors.com/rb20det/">Website Credit</a></p>
