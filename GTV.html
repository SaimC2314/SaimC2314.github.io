    <p>It is quite popular representative of RB series. It appeared in 1991 and replaced <mark>RB20DET</mark>. <mark>RB25DE</mark> used cylinder block similar to <mark>RB20</mark>, but with cylinder         diameter enlarged to 86 mm. Also it was equipped with crankshaft with piston stroke 71.7 mm, new connecting rods and pistons.
        Cylinder head had two camshafts with 4 valves per cylinder. The early models (to 1993) were not equipped with variable valve timing system NVCS.
        <mark>RB25DE S1</mark> camshafts: duration 240/232 deg, lift 7.8/7.3 mm. Such <mark>RB25DE S1 (Series 1)</mark> developed 180 HP at 6,000 RPM. These engines were installed on Nissan Skyline R32.
        Later, in 1993 (when Skyline R33 appeared), NVCS system was used on intake camshaft. <mark>RB25DE</mark> camshafts: duration 240/240 deg, lift 7.8/7.8 mm. Thanks to <mark>RB25DE</mark> the power increased to 190 HP at 6,400 RPM. The engine was applied for Nissan Skyline R33.
        Since 1995, ignition system, MAF, crankshaft position sensor and ECU were modified.
        In 1998, new engine model <mark>RB25DE NEO</mark> was designed specially for Nissan Skyline R34. This engine is compliant with high ecological standards and it is equipped with new intake manifold with thin runners. Also <mark>RB25DE NEO</mark> has head with modified compression chambers, new camshafts and improved exhaust manifold. <mark>RB25DE NEO</mark> camshafts have duration 236/232 deg, lift 8.4/6.9 mm. Also such engines do not have hydraulic lifters. <mark>RB25DE NEO</mark> power increased to 200 HP at 6,400, torque 231 NM at 4,800 RPM.
        Along with naturally aspirated engine, well-known turbocharged modification <mark>RB25DET</mark> was produced also.
        The first version <mark>(RB25DET S1)</mark> appeared in 1993 and was installed on Nissan Skyline R33. In contrast to <mark>RB25DET, RB25DE (S1)</mark> had reinforced connecting rods, new pistons (compression ratio is 8.5), 45V1 turbocharger. The turbocharger was larger than 16V of <mark>RB20DET</mark>. Maximal boost pressure on RB25DET reached 7 psi (0.5 bar). Also that version was equipped with variable valve timing system NVCS on the intake side, fuel injector 370 cc/min, and oil jets were installed in cylinder block. The engineâ€™s power was 245-250 HP at 6,400 RPM, torque 272 m at 4,800 RPM.
        By analogy with <mark>RB25DE</mark>, in 1995 the engine was restyled: ignition system, MAF, crankshaft position sensor and also ECU were changed. Besides, it was equipped with new 45V2 turbocharger with plastic impeller instead of the steel. Those were <mark>RB25DET S2</mark> engines.
        In 1998 the engine was modified and named <mark>RB25DET NEO</mark>.
        These engines were in compliance with higher ecological standards. Besides, they differed from <mark>RB25DET</mark> with new crankshaft, <mark>RB26DETT</mark> rods, modified pistons, compression ratio increased to 9, oil jets, improved intake manifold. Besides, the intake ports and combustion chambers were upgraded, head flow raised. This engine used solid lifters instead of the familiar hydraulic lifters.
        <mark>RB25DET NEO</mark> camshafts: duration 236/232 deg, lift 8.4/8.7 mm. Stock fuel injectors are 340 cc/min.
        <mark>RB25DET NEO</mark> engines use 45V3 turbocharger with enlarged exhaust housing and plastic impeller, boost pressure is 10 psi (0.7 bar). All these performance mods increased the power to 280 HP at 6,400 RPM, and torque 334 NM at 3,200 RPM.
        Later, since 2001, 45V4 turbocharger with steel impeller was installed.
        There is no need to adjust the valves on <mark>RB25DE/DET</mark> engines, since they use hydraulic lifters. But if you have <mark>RB25DE NEO</mark> or <mark>RB25DET NEO</mark>, then you should adjust valve clearance from time to time.
        <mark>RB25DET/DE</mark> uses timing belt, which should be changed every 60,000 miles of mileage (90,000 km).
        Besides this engine, Nissan RB series included <mark>RB20, RB24S, RB26DETT and RB30.
        RB25</mark> were discontinued in 2002 and instead, <mark>VQ25DE/DET</mark> appeared. - <a href="http://mywikimotors.com/rb25det/">Website Credit</a></p>
